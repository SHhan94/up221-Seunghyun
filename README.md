# up221-Seunghyun
Hello class! My name is Seunghyun Han. I know it is so hard to pronounce, so just call me by Han. Oh, I am from South korea and I'm a first year MURP student at UCLA, Concentration in Climate, environment, and society but not first year at UCLA, becase I also studied at UCLA during my undergrad. 

I am kind of worriying about this class because I have never used GIS, github, jupyterlab, phytons. I took one R class like 4 years ago at UCLA. So, not sure I can handle it, but hope I could!

I am intersted in Urban forest, envriornment inequalities, and air quality. I think my project is going to be about urban forest.
